# License Validation Software
This software provides a license validation system for your applications, ensuring that only authorized users can access your software. With this software, you can validate license keys and check their status in real-time, providing a secure and reliable licensing solution. 

## Features:
* License Validation (C#):
When a user enters their license key, the software sends a request to the server to validate the key. The validation process includes checking the existence of the key, verifying it against the correct hardware ID, and ensuring it has not been revoked. 
* License Checking:
* Each time the software is opened, a request is sent to the server to check the license status. This involves re-validating the license key and hardware ID to ensure continued authorized access. 
* Server-Side Implementation (PHP):
* The server-side implementation includes an API that handles license validation and checking requests. This API allows seamless integration with your own server infrastructure, providing a secure and efficient licensing solution.
